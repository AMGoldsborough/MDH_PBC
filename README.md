# MDH_PBC
Ma, Dasgupta, Hu (MDH) strong disorder renormalisation (SDRG) with periodic boundaries (PBC)

This code was used as a comparison to disordered MERA in the paper "Entanglement renormalization for disordered systems" by Andrew M. Goldsborough and Glen Evenbly. https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07652.

Performs the original SDRG algorithm on disordered Heisenberg XXX and XX models. Based on the paper "Low-temperature properties of the random Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain" by Chandan Dasgupta and Shang-keng Ma. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.22.1305
